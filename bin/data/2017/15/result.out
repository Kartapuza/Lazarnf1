They found a way late against the Ravens, but the defense has been bad against the pass the past three games. That won't be a good look against Tom Brady.

The lack of a pass rush showed up against the Dolphins. That can't happen against Ben Roethlisberger.

I will keep them here, even with the news of Carson Wentz going down for the season. But can they win with Nick Foles?

Don't look now, but Blake Bortles is playing good football. If he can continue that, watch out for this team come playoff time.

That might have been a season-saving interception by Deion Jones of Drew Brees late last week. If they win out, they win the division.

If they beat the Rams this week at home, they are in first place. But they just don't have the same feel about them as they did in recent years.

That loss to the Steelers will sting. But they still control their road to a playoff spot and they have a soft schedule to close out the season.
