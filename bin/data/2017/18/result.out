Patriots
They head to the postseason with the playoffs going through Foxboro. They remain the favorite.

Steelers
The question now for them is whether they can beat the Patriots in Foxboro. I have my doubts.

Nick Foles does not give the Eagles much hope of advancing to the Super Bowl. If they had Carson Wentz, they would be the favorite.

Vikings
They have a defense and the running game has come to life. Mike Zimmer is coach of the year.

Rams
Rams
They rested guys against the 49ers to get ready for the playoffs. Now they will face a tough challenge in the 2016 NFC-champion Atlanta Falcons.

Saints
Saints
The defense didn't look good last week, but they will be a dangerous team in the playoffs. Drew Brees has been there before.

Panthers
Panthers
They didn't play well on defense the past two weeks -- giving up nearly 700 yards passing -- and that has to be concerning heading to New Orleans.

Jaguars
Jaguars
They looked bad the past two weeks, but they still got a home playoff game. If they play like they did at Tennessee, they could be a one-and-done team.

Chiefs
Chiefs
They found their quarterback of the future in Patrick Mahomes, but this is about Alex Smith now. Can he take them to a Super Bowl?

Falcons
Falcons
That offense we saw against the Panthers was a much better Falcons offense than what they've showed most of the season. This is a playoff-tested team, which will help this week at the Rams.

They are in the playoffs for the first time since 1999. Sean McDermott has done an amazing job this season.

Titans
Titans
They found a way to beat the Jaguars Sunday to get into the playoffs, but they haven't looked like a playoff team the past six weeks. Can they turn it on against the Chiefs?

Ravens
That was a major choke job against the Bengals. That should mean changes are coming to the staff.

Seahawks
Seahawks
They need to rebuild their team around Russell Wilson. The days of running the football and playing great defense should not be the focus anymore.

Cowboys
Cowboys
The loss of Ezekiel Elliott for six games really impacted the Cowboys, but they need Dak Prescott to get better. What do they do with Dez Bryant?

Chargers
Chargers
They will again look back at all the close games they lost and wonder why they are sitting home. They would have been a dangerous playoff team.

Lions

Jim Caldwell is out as coach, which means general manager Bob Quinn can pick his guy. Will it be a former Patriots assistant who worked with Quinn in New England?

Cardinals
Cardinals
The defense really took steps forward in the second half of the season, which they can build upon next year. Who's the next coach now that Bruce Arians is retiring?

Packers
Packers
They will have a new defensive coordinator with Dom Capers on his way out, but whoever takes over needs much better players on that side of the ball.

They played well the final two weeks for Marvin Lewis. What happens next for the Bengals? Is Lewis back or not?

Raiders
Raiders
With Jack Del Rio out, it looks like it will be Jon Gruden taking over. He won a Super Bowl in Tampa Bay, but look at his last six years with the team. Not so good.

The injuries crippled this team this season. Now they have to keep Kirk Cousins, no matter what.

They head to the offseason feeling good about their 5-0 finish with Jimmy Garoppolo. Watch out next season.

They are bringing Dirk Koetter back, which is the right move. The offense came alive the past three weeks.

Adam Gase is coming back, but they have some major decisions to make. Who will be the quarterback?

John Fox is out as coach, and I would expect they would hire a coach with an offensive background to take over to work with Mitchell Trubisky.

Giving Todd Bowles a contract extension was the right thing to do. Now they need to find a quarterback.

In the end, the injuries decimated this team. But they can storm back next season as a playoff contender when everybody is healthy.

They did it. They went 0-16. But they have a lot of assets for John Dorsey to fix this thing.
