It took them a while to get going against the Bills, but as usual they found a way. Beat the Jets this week, and the top seed is theirs.

Steelers

They bounced back from the loss to the Patriots by blowing out the Texans on the road. They are the likely second seed heading into the postseason.

They beat the Raiders Monday night, but they just don't look like a Super team anymore. They aren't winning a title with Nick Foles.

If the defense plays like it did against the Falcons, they might be the NFC's best team. They still need a victory to lock up the division title.

Panthers
Panthers
That wasn't a great effort against Tampa Bay, but they rallied to earn a playoff spot. They can still win the division if they beat Atlanta and the Saints lose.

Vikings

They are the No. 2 seed in the NFC. There's a chance they could not play away from their stadium the rest of the way - Super Bowl included.

Rams

They are going to be a real problem for any team in the playoffs.  They can run it with Todd Gurley and now the defense is playing better.

They clinched the division before getting blown out in San Francisco. That was not a good look for a team that some thought could make a Super push.

If they win this week against the Bengals, they are in the playoffs. The defense will be what will make them dangerous in the postseason.

They have righted things the past three weeks as they head to the playoffs. There are still defensive concerns.

Seahawks

They are still alive in the playoff race thanks to a nice showing by the defense against the Cowboys. They need Atlanta to lose and then beat Arizona to get into the postseason party.

They just aren't generating enough offense and need to beat the Panthers this week to ensure they make the playoffs.

Their playoff chances went bye-bye thanks to some questionable coaching in the loss to Seattle. But it looks like Jason Garrett will be back.

Bills

Their playoff chances pretty much died in New England - unless they get major help. They just aren't good enough and now have to decide what to do at quarterback.

They are still alive, but they need to win this week and get some help.  It's possible.

They've lost three straight but can still get into the playoffs if they beat the Jaguars this week. They will be limping in for sure.

Losing at Cincinnati with the playoffs still possible is not a good look. Is Jim Caldwell in trouble?

Shutting Aaron Rodgers down for the season was the right thing to do. They have to make changes to the staff.

The defense impressed in the shutout of the Giants. That unit has a lot of young players to build around next year.

They showed some fight in Philadelphia Monday night, but this is still a disappointing season. Jack Del Rio will likely be back.

They have to be thrilled with the 4-0 start by Jimmy Garoppolo. They need to sign him to a long-term deal as soon as they can.

It's obvious Brock Osweiler isn't the answer at quarterback. Now it's Paxton Lynch for a week.

There is hope for next season with the way they are growing as a team. They have their franchise passer, that's for sure.

The Bryce Petty era isn't off to a good start - if there is such a thing as the Petty era. Why not give Christian Hackenberg a try?
