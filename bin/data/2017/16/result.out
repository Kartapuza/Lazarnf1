By beating the Steelers, the NFL playoffs will likely go through Foxborough. Beating the Patriots will be tough to do in their building come January.

Steelers
11-3-0
The health of receiver Antonio Brown is the important thing. They will still likely be the No. 2 seed in the AFC, but he has to be back for the playoffs.

Eagles
12-2-0
Nick Foles did a nice job against the Giants, but Eli Manning shredded that defense. That's two weeks in a row that unit has struggled.

Saints

It wasn't pretty against the Jets, and they will have to be better against the Falcons this week. But you have to win those types of games.

Panthers

They are getting it going at the right time. Cam Newton looked like the Newton of 2015 against the Packers.

Jaguars

They are a playoff team as of right now, but they want a lot more than that. That defense is special.

The Vikings are playing for the No. 1 seed the next two weeks. If they get it, Mike Zimmer might be the coach of the year.

That was a statement victory at Seattle. The message was sent: They will be a factor in the playoffs.

That wasn't pretty in Tampa on Monday night, but now they have to regroup quickly for the big one at New Orleans. Where is Julio Jones in their offense?

They held on against the Raiders and still have playoff hopes. Ezekiel Elliott will be back this week to help make it happen.

Their task is simple: Win their final two and they are in the playoffs. That means beating the Colts and Bengals at home. They are getting in.

They are eliminated from playoff contention, which means they will likely shut down Aaron Rodgers -- and they should.

Derek Carr fumbled their playoff chances out of the end zone late against Dallas. They have to be one of the biggest disappointments this season.
