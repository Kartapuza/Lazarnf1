Case Keenum is playing outstanding football to go with that impressive defense. They face a tough road trip to Carolina this week.

They would be the second seed now in the conference after losing to Seattle and they face a tough road game against the Rams. That's a tough turnaround.

If they can beat the Falcons on the road at Atlanta, they will essentially have a two-game lead in the division with three to go. Alvin Kamara has been sensational.

Aside from Russell Wilson's outstanding play, the defense is coming off a good showing against the Eagles. That's a good sign with all the injuries.

Their defense is carrying this team, but Blake Bortles had his best game throwing it last week. They will need him this week against Seattle.

They saved their season - for now - by beating the Redskins last week. They can make a real push down the stretch with a soft schedule.

At least they know they have a weapon for the future with Josh Gordon back. But who will be throwing to him?
