Steelers

They found a way late against the Ravens, but the defense has been bad against the pass the past three games. That won't be a good look against Tom Brady.

Patriots

The lack of a pass rush showed up against the Dolphins. That can't happen against Ben Roethlisberger.

Eagles

I will keep them here, even with the news of Carson Wentz going down for the season. But can they win with Nick Foles?

That was a tough one last week at Atlanta, with some questionable officiating calls, and now they have to re-group but are still in first place in the division.

Cam Newton came up big in the big moment in a big game against Minnesota. That's what's going to carry this team the rest of the way.

Don't look now, but Blake Bortles is playing good football. If he can continue that, watch out for this team come playoff time.

Playing three consecutive road games was tough, but going 2-1 in that stretch is impressive.

They have to find a way to win the games against the best of the NFC. Now comes a big division game with Seattle.

That might have been a season-saving interception by Deion Jones of Drew Brees late last week. If they win out, they win the division.

Seahawks

If they beat the Rams this week at home, they are in first place. But they just don't have the same feel about them as they did in recent years.

Chargers

They are riding high heading into Arrowhead to play the Chiefs. The winner of that game will likely win the division.

They got a big game from Dak Prescott against the Giants to stay alive. They need more of that down the stretch.

Playing close games finally caught up to them at Arizona. They are now in second place in the AFC South playing the chase game.

Ravens

That loss to the Steelers will sting. But they still control their road to a playoff spot and they have a soft schedule to close out the season.

They had to get that comeback victory against the Browns to stay alive. Now they might have Aaron Rodgers back.

Matt Stafford toughed it out to win at Tampa Bay, which kept their season alive. The need to win out to have a chance to get into the playoffs.

That loss at Kansas City should be the dagger in their season. Derek Carr hasn't been good enough.

They looked like a different team against the Patriots. Jay Cutler was really good, keeping their slim playoff hopes alive.

The defense has done some really good things the past month. That has to give them hope for next season.

That was a horror show against the Chargers. They are toast and now have to decide what to do with Kirk Cousins.

They have to be thrilled with the way some of their younger players are playing, especially Mitchell Trubisky. That was an impressive win at Cincinnati.

They had their chance to get their first victory, but blew a 14-point lead to the Packers. That was so Browns-like.
