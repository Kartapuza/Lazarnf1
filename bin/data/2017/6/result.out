Steelers

They found a way late against the Ravens, but the defense has been bad against the pass the past three games. That won't be a good look against Tom Brady.

The lack of a pass rush showed up against the Dolphins. That can't happen against Ben Roethlisberger.

I will keep them here, even with the news of Carson Wentz going down for the season. But can they win with Nick Foles?

That was a tough one last week at Atlanta, with some questionable officiating calls, and now they have to re-group but are still in first place in the division.

Cam Newton came up big in the big moment in a big game against Minnesota. That's what's going to carry this team the rest of the way.

Don't look now, but Blake Bortles is playing good football. If he can continue that, watch out for this team come playoff time.

Playing three consecutive road games was tough, but going 2-1 in that stretch is impressive.

They have to find a way to win the games against the best of the NFC. Now comes a big division game with Seattle.

That might have been a season-saving interception by Deion Jones of Drew Brees late last week. If they win out, they win the division.

If they beat the Rams this week at home, they are in first place. But they just don't have the same feel about them as they did in recent years.

They are riding high heading into Arrowhead to play the Chiefs. The winner of that game will likely win the division.

They got a big game from Dak Prescott against the Giants to stay alive. They need more of that down the stretch.

Playing close games finally caught up to them at Arizona. They are now in second place in the AFC South playing the chase game.

That loss to the Steelers will sting. But they still control their road to a playoff spot and they have a soft schedule to close out the season.

They had to get that comeback victory against the Browns to stay alive. Now they might have Aaron Rodgers back.

Matt Stafford toughed it out to win at Tampa Bay, which kept their season alive. The need to win out to have a chance to get into the playoffs.

They have to be thrilled with the way some of their younger players are playing, especially Mitchell Trubisky. That was an impressive win at Cincinnati.
