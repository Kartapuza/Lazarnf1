The Aaron Rodgers situation bears watching, but if he's playing they are the best team in my book.

The offense was limited against the Giants, so that has to change. But the defense is special and they get a major chance to show it against the Pats this week.

They look like the same Patriots - a lot of Tom Brady and the great coaching of Bill Belichick. The beat goes on.

The defense came up big in the second half against Oakland. Now comes a division game against Arizona on a short week.

Case Keenum did a lot of good, but also some bad. He has to clean up the bad if this is going to be a playoff team.

That was an impressive showing in Los Angeles against the Chargers. Patrick Mahomes is the real deal, but faces a tough road game at Pittsburgh.

Tying the Browns is really like a loss. They need to regroup quickly against the Chiefs.

It's hard to win on the road in the NFL, so don't overreact to the Week One loss to the Eagles. This team will be a playoff team.

If Joe Flacco plays like he did against the Bills, they will be a playoff team. That's a big if.

They were outstanding on offense on the road in upsetting the Saints. But can Ryan Fitzpatrick come close to duplicating it this week against the Eagles?

If moral victories count, they got one against the Packers. But they don't. They are a better team now than a year ago - that's for sure.

They lost a tough one at Denver, but now face a back-to-back road game at Chicago. Not having Doug Baldwin will hurt.

That loss to the Jets was putrid. That's not a good way for Matt Patricia to start his head-coaching stint. Can they respond against the 49ers?

This team is bad and they have to make a change at quarterback. Just play Josh Allen. But they aren't.
