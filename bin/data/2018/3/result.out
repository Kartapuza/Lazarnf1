The Aaron Rodgers situation bears watching, but if he's playing they are the best team in my book.

Jaguars
2-0-0
The offense was limited against the Giants, so that has to change. But the defense is special and they get a major chance to show it against the Pats this week.

Patriots

They look like the same Patriots - a lot of Tom Brady and the great coaching of Bill Belichick. The beat goes on.

It wasn't pretty against the Falcons, but they found a way. That's the sign of a good team.

The Kirk Cousins era got off to a good start, but now comes a tough road game against the Packers.

The defense came up big in the second half against Oakland. Now comes a division game against Arizona on a short week.

Case Keenum did a lot of good, but also some bad. He has to clean up the bad if this is going to be a playoff team.

That was an impressive showing in Los Angeles against the Chargers. Patrick Mahomes is the real deal, but faces a tough road game at Pittsburgh.

Tying the Browns is really like a loss. They need to regroup quickly against the Chiefs.

The injuries to Greg Olsen and right tackle Darryl Williams damper their victory over the Cowboys. Now here come the Falcons in a division game.

Falcons

It's hard to win on the road in the NFL, so don't overreact to the Week One loss to the Eagles. This team will be a playoff team.

Ravens

If Joe Flacco plays like he did against the Bills, they will be a playoff team. That's a big if.

That was an ugly showing against the Bucs. What happened to the defense?

Bengals

They showed something by coming from behind on the road against the Colts. This is a team that could be sneaky good this year.

They didn't look good in losing to the Chiefs at home. Will they have another slow start for a team some thought could be a Super Bowl contender?

They face almost a must-win against the Titans this week. They can't afford to start 0-2.

Buccaneers

They were outstanding on offense on the road in upsetting the Saints. But can Ryan Fitzpatrick come close to duplicating it this week against the Eagles?

The injuries to their offense will make for a tough challenge against the Texans this week. They, too, have to avoid 0-2.

Their defense just isn't good enough. You think they missed Khalil Mack Monday against the Rams?

Where's the offense? They didn't have much of it against the Panthers. At some point, that has to change.

If moral victories count, they got one against the Packers. But they don't. They are a better team now than a year ago - that's for sure.

They lost a tough one at Denver, but now face a back-to-back road game at Chicago. Not having Doug Baldwin will hurt.

That was a dud against the Redskins. If it stays that way for the offense, when do they turn to Josh Rosen?

The offense couldn't get much going against the Jaguars. That has to change in a big division game against the Cowboys this week.

That loss to the Jets was putrid. That's not a good way for Matt Patricia to start his head-coaching stint. Can they respond against the 49ers?

Getting Andrew Luck back will make them competitive, but that defense can be a season-long problem.

This team is bad and they have to make a change at quarterback. Just play Josh Allen. But they aren't.
